<h1>The Best Movies According to Javier :)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Amazing Spider-Man</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed this film in my childhood. 
    I LOVE Spider-Man and this movie was everything for me
    as a fan. I also had a crush on Emma Stone.

<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>
    This film is amazing. I love the scenery
    and the whole aesthetic of the movie. I really
    enjoy mafia movies and this is one of the best.
</p>
<h3>Batman Begins</h3>
<p>
    I love Batman and this movie is my favorite
    Batman movie ever made. I love seeing Bruce becoming
    Batman, the training montages and the suit being made.
